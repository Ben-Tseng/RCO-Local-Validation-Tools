Privacy Policy

This extension is designed to operate entirely offline and does not collect,
store, transmit, or share any personal data.

All validation logic, including MRZ validation, Hong Kong ID validation,
Taiwan ID validation, and date consistency checks, is executed locally within
the user's browser and only when explicitly triggered by the user.

No data is sent to any external servers.
No analytics, tracking, or logging mechanisms are implemented.
No user input is stored persistently.

The extension only processes user-selected text at the moment a context menu
action is invoked. All data is discarded immediately after the validation result
is displayed.

If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact the
repository owner.
